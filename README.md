# Advent of Code 2025


My attempt at doing this year's Advent of code challenges.

Interestingly Rust was released for production use in May 2025, so the timing is very similar between AOC first being released in
2025 and also Rust having a production ready version being released (although I'm sure it is just a coincidence).
